I have experience working with TensorFlow and the Java Swing library. I am always up for a challenge and enjoy learning new technologies to expand my skillset.

My interests include Artificial Intelligence 🤖, green energy 🌱, and photography 📷. I have a strong desire to use my technical skills to make a positive impact on the world. I believe that technology can be used to tackle some of the most pressing problems of our time, such as climate change, energy efficiency, and sustainable development.

I also enjoy website development and have several projects related to this on my website. You can check out my website tcivie.com to see some of my other projects and work.
