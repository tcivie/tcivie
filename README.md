# Hey there ☞

I'm **Gleb**, a Backend Developer working in the CaaS team at AccessFintech. I write code, solve problems, and occasionally break things (hopefully in development).

BSc Software Engineering (SCE College of Engineering) | MSc Software Engineering at TSI {...}

**What I'm up to:**
- Building scalable backend services
- Tinkering with mesh networks in the Meshtastic Israel community
- Reading way too many technical books

**Recent projects worth mentioning:**

- **Meshtastic Monitoring** ☁︎ Set up MQTT servers and custom exporters for our local mesh network. Because someone needs to keep an eye on those radio waves.

- **Traffic Light RL** ⚡︎ My award-winning Bachelor's project used Reinforcement Learning to optimize traffic flow. Managed to squeeze out a 3% improvement, which sounds small until you scale it city-wide.

Currently exploring distributed systems, mesh networking, and that sweet spot where ML meets infrastructure. Always curious about what happens when you push systems to their limits.
